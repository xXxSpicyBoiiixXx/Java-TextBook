/*
 *  Every line of code that runs in Java must
 *  be inside a "class". In our example, we 
 *  named the class "Main". A class should 
 *  always start with an uppercase first 
 *  letter. 
 *
 *  Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass"
 *  and "myclass" has different meaning.
 *
 *  The name of the java file MUST MATCH the 
 *  class name. When saving the file, save it 
 *  using the class name and add ".java" to 
 *  the end of the filename.

    public static void main(String[] args) {

}

// The Main Method

/*
 *  The "main()" method is required and you 
 *  will see it in every Java program: 
 *
 *  public static void main(String[] args)
 *
 *  Any code inside the "main()" method 
 *  will be executed. Don't worry about the 
 *  keywords before and after main for now. 
 *  We will discuss them here shortly. 
 *
 *  For now, just rememeber that every Java
 *  program has a "class" name which must 
 *  match the filename, and that every
 *  program must contain the "main()" method. 
 */

// System.out.println() 

/*
 *  Inside the "main()" method, we can use 
 *  the "println()" method to print a line
 *  of text to the screen such as: 
 *
 *  System.out.println("your text"); 
 *
 */

// Some other notes... 

/*
 *  The curly braces "{}" marks he beginning
 *  and he end of a block of code.
 *
 *  "System" is a built-in Java class that
 *  contains useful members, such as "out",
 *  which is short for "output". The 
 *  "println()" method, short for 
 *  "print line", is used to print a value 
 *  to the screen (or a file).
 *
 *  Don't worry too much about "System",
 *  "out", and "println()". Just know that 
 *  you need them together to print stuff to
 *  the screen. 
 *
 *  You should also note that each code 
 *  statement must end with a semicolon ";".
 *  You can think of this like a period in 
 *  a sentence.
