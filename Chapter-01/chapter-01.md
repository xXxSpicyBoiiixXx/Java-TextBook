# Introduction

Welcome to my course! My name is Professor Ali as you may already have had an introduction or you may be reading ahead. Either way, nice to have you in my course this semester. So all of you are here to learn about coding more specifically object oriented programming. What is object oriented programming you may ask? Well that's an excellent question. Before coding and going right into things, we will need to define certain principals that are essential to object oriented programming and what makes it unique. We will breifly go over the overall concepts of object oriented programming and then start programming our first program towards the end of this chapter.  

### Objectives of this book 

This text strives to focus on three core elements:

1) A solid understading of object oriented programming in Java 
2) Basic sorting algorithms
3) Basic data structures 

### What is Object Oriented Programming?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects." It is a way of designing and organizing code to represent real-world entities and their interactions. OOP provides a structured approach to software development, making it more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain.

### Key Concepts of OOP

1. Objects: Objects are instances of classes and represent real-world entities. They encapsulate data and behavior.

2. Classes: Classes are blueprints or templates for creating objects. They define the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have.

3. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, known as a class. It helps in hiding the internal details of how an object works.

4. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.

5. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables flexibility in handling various object types through a common interface.

6. Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors. It helps in managing system complexity.

### Objects and Classes

#### Objects 

- Definition: An object is a self-contained unit that represents a real-world entity. It encapsulates data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data.

- Example: In a banking application, an "Account" object might have attributes like account number, balance, and owner, along with methods like deposit and withdraw.

#### Classes

- Definition: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects instantiated from the class will have.

- Example: Continuing with the banking application example, the "Account" class would define attributes like account number and balance, and methods like deposit and withdraw.
